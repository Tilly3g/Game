# Simon Game

This is a website where a user can play an online version of the Simon game.

The Simon game is a memory game where the computer will play a random sequence of light flashes, each with their own sound,
and then the user has to repeat them in the correct order. 

There is also a strict mode option. When strict mode is enabled, if the user presses the wrong coloured button and the sequence they have clicked doesn't match the computer sequence then the game will start again and go back to level one and a new random sequence will be generated. When strict mode is disabled, if the user gets the sequence wrong then the level will remain the same and the computer will play the same sequence again to remind the user and they can try again at the same stage after that.


## Deployment

The game is deployed at https://tilly3g.github.io/Game/.
